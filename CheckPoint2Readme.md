URL to our deployed application: http://autocar.pythonanywhere.com/

User manual:
To run our application, the link will take you directly to the homepage of our application. From there, you will see a navigation bar that includes a link to the homepage, dashboard, downloads available, login and signup. Without logging in, you will be able to access any of these tabs. However, to work on or create any new projects (which are renting cars or joining/creating carshares in our appliocation), you will be directed to the login screen. If you do not have a login, there is an option to signup for our application. If you are not logged in, you can still see the dashboard of cars available for checkout. After you have logged in, the dashboard tab is where all of the HW sets checking in and out will happen. After going to the dashboard, you will see all of the available cars to checkout. If a car is already checked out, it will not show up on the dashboard (Each HW set only has 1 availability). The car will be connected to that car share id or rental id until it is returned. If another user wants to join one's carshare, they will be able to by entering the maker's groupID that they created when starting the car share.
